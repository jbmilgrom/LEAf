  # The session hash receives the key value pair of {:user_id => id_of_a_user} when a user signs up through (i) the '/sign_up' get request and (ii) the '/log_in' get request.
  # The "session" is only destroyed (i.e session[:user_id] = nil) when the user sends a get request to '/log_out'
  # Calling current_user in any descendent controller returns a User instance unless the key value pair of {:user_id => id_of_a_user} has yet to be introduced into the session hash.
